Shape/Shift
===========

About
-----

A game about shapes which shift... and also shapeshift. Command triangles,
squares, pentagons, hexagons around. They (you) solve puzzles.

Project for Ludum Dare 35, theme is "Shapeshift".

TODO
====

- Sprite atlas.
- Much of the logic in the 'Play' state looks suspiciously generic and can very
  likely be extracted into methods and/or classes. Especially true for the
  different in-game objects (not buttons or arrows).

Thank you!

I am standing on the shoulders of giants. This is a short (?) list of software,
libraries, etc., I used. Without them, this game would not have been possible.

Alphabetically ordered.

- [https://www.debian.org/](Debian) as operating system
- [https://www.mozilla.org/firefox](Firefox) for testing purposes
- [http://www.gimp.org/](GIMP) for graphics
